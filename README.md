# WireMock Integration Testing Demo

This repository contains a simple demonstration of using [WireMock.Net](https://github.com/WireMock-Net/WireMock.Net) to simulate HTTP interactions in a distributed system.

The goal is to show how developers can decouple their testing strategies from downstream dependencies—like payment gateways, third-party APIs, or unstable services—by using WireMock as a local HTTP server that simulates different network responses.
